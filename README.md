# FiguraLibs
Libraries I've created for the Minecraft Figura mod.

Each library has its own README.md file for more info about it, such as docs and examples.

## Current Libraries:

[Zoid's IK](https://github.com/TheZoidMaster/FiguraLibs/tree/main/ZoidsIK): A simple FABRIK implementation, designed for ease of use.
